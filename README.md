This is React(client)/Node(server) app with authorization function. I used typescript for both applications. The database is Mongodb with Mongoose. 

  - **Spec:** React.ts [TS], Node.js [TS], Express, MongoDB/Mongoose, CSS, Netify
  - **Server Side:** [Click here](https://github.com/erika-goodwin/a-0521-node-finalpr-client/tree/master)

### Why did I make this?

I wanted to try creating authorization function... but to be honest, it was hard!!!! My motto is 'try something new at least one!' For this project, it was trying Typescript. My developer friends told me that Typescript is better to practice since you will find errors easily and immediately. It was true and I liked it, but it also caused so many problems later...

### What was challenging?

Of course, making the client and server was hard work. But deployment was even harder. Since I used Typescript, things are different from what I used to do and it was confusing. It took so many hours to solve many errors. Yet my knowledge and patience got better.

### Goals for Improvement

I want to learn the file structuring skill to make the project accessible to other engineers. For now, I work on projects by myself, and files are organized for me. Yet always other people's files are difficult to find by name or structures. I'd like to improve my file structuring skill in preparation for real-world work experience.
